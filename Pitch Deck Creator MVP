# Pitch Deck Creator: MVP Decisions

**Final decisions for 1-2 week MVP implementation**  
**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Decision Owner:** CEO/CMO (Sreedeep Surapaneni)

***

## Decision 1: Post-Generation Editing Capability

**DECISION: Download-only with regeneration option**

**Rationale:**
- **MVP Speed:** Building or integrating an editor adds 3-5 days to timeline
- **Gamma's Strength:** Users can edit natively in Gamma after download if they purchase Gamma accounts
- **Regeneration Pattern:** If deck isn't right, user clicks "Regenerate with feedback" → provides natural language notes → system reruns with adjustments
- **Cost Control:** No need to implement complex edit state management or version control

**Implementation:**
- Preview page shows embedded Gamma deck (read-only iframe)
- Action buttons:
  - **Download PPTX** (primary CTA)
  - **Download PDF** (secondary)
  - **Share Link** (Gamma view-only URL)
  - **Regenerate** (opens modal: "What would you like to change?" → text input → reruns job with additional context)
- Feedback input stored in job metadata, appended to Claude prompts on regeneration

**User Flow:**
1. User previews deck
2. If satisfied → Downloads PPTX
3. If not satisfied → Clicks "Regenerate" → Types: "Make slide 4 more data-driven, add ROI chart on slide 7"
4. System regenerates with feedback as additional context in content generation prompts
5. New version ready in ~3 minutes

**Post-MVP:** Integrate Gamma's AI Agent API (if they expose it) for in-place edits without regeneration

***

## Decision 2: Service Catalog Creation

**DECISION: User manually creates YAML with 8-12 core services**

**Rationale:**
- **Quality Control:** LakeB2B services require nuanced positioning that AI scraping won't capture accurately
- **One-Time Cost:** 2-3 hours to write comprehensive service catalog, then it's done
- **Flexibility:** User controls exact messaging, pain point mappings, and ROI claims
- **No Scraping Risk:** Website scraping is brittle (site changes break system), may miss internal services not listed publicly

**Implementation:**
- CEO/CMO (you) writes `services_catalog.yaml` following Section 2 schema
- File stored in `/data/services_catalog.yaml` in repo
- System loads catalog at startup, caches in memory
- **8-12 services for MVP** (not all 15-20):
  - Custom B2B Data Enrichment ✓
  - Tech Stack Intelligence ✓
  - Intent Data Platform ✓
  - Custom AI Agent Development ✓
  - Predictive Lead Scoring ✓
  - SDR Training Bootcamp ✓
  - GTM Playbook Consulting ✓
  - ABM Campaign Execution ✓
  - Demand Gen as a Service ✓
  - (3 more if needed)

**Time Investment:**
- **Day 0 (before dev starts):** You spend 2-3 hours filling out `services_catalog.yaml` template provided in Section 2
- **Validation:** Claude Code reviews for completeness (all required fields present)

**Future Enhancement (Month 2):**
- Build admin UI for service catalog editing (add/edit/archive services)
- Version control for catalog changes
- A/B test different service descriptions

## Decision 3: Pain Point Discovery Slide

**DECISION: Static visual layout with 3 options, non-interactive (with smart speaker notes)**

**Rationale:**
- **Gamma API Limitation:** Unclear if Gamma Pro API supports true interactivity (clickable branching)
- **Presentation Reality:** Most pitch decks are delivered as downloads or screenshares, not interactive web experiences
- **Workaround via Speaker Notes:** Include all 3 pain point paths in deck, use speaker notes to guide presenter on which slides to emphasize based on prospect's selection

**Implementation:**

**Slide 3 Structure:**
```
Headline: "Which Challenge Resonates Most with Your Team?"

Body (3 visually distinct boxes):
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ A. CRM Data Quality     │
│ 60% outdated, low       │
│ deliverability          │
└─────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────┐
│ B. SDR Productivity     │
│ 10 hrs/week on manual   │
│ research                │
└─────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────┐
│ C. Intent Blind Spots   │
│ No visibility into      │
│ buyer signals           │
└─────────────────────────┘

Speaker Notes: "PAUSE HERE. Ask prospect: 'Which resonates most?' 
- If A: Focus on slides 4-6 (data enrichment)
- If B: Emphasize slides 7-9 (productivity gains)  
- If C: Highlight slides 10-12 (intent data)
All paths included—tailor emphasis to their answer."
```

**Deck Architecture:**
- Slide 3: Pain point selection (visual only)
- Slides 4-6: Deep dive on Pain Point A + Solution
- Slides 7-9: Deep dive on Pain Point B + Solution
- Slides 10-12: Deep dive on Pain Point C + Solution
- Slides 13-14: ROI summary (covers all 3 scenarios)
- Slide 15: Next steps

**Total Deck Length:** 15-16 slides (comprehensive but presenter picks path)

**Benefit:** Works perfectly for async delivery (prospect downloads deck, reads relevant sections) AND live presentation (presenter adapts on the fly)

**Post-MVP:** If Gamma releases interactive API features, retrofit with true clickable branching

***

## Decision 4: Branding Application

**DECISION: Use Gamma's default "Professional" theme with LakeB2B color override**

**Rationale:**
- **Speed:** No brand kit upload UI, no asset management
- **Gamma's Design Quality:** Professional theme is clean and modern
- **Color Control:** Gamma API accepts `primaryColor` and `secondaryColor` hex codes—sufficient for MVP brand consistency
- **Logo Limitation Acceptable:** Gamma may not perfectly place logo on every slide, but title slide logo is enough for MVP

**Implementation:**

**Gamma API Branding Block:**
```json
{
  "theme": "professional",
  "branding": {
    "primaryColor": "#00A9E0",      // LakeB2B blue (use on CTA buttons, accents)
    "secondaryColor": "#1A1A1A",    // Dark gray for text
    "logoUrl": "https://lakeb2b.com/assets/logo-horizontal-white-bg.png"
  }
}
```

**Hardcoded Brand Assets:**
- Store LakeB2B logo URL in environment variable: `LAKEB2B_LOGO_URL`
- Colors hardcoded in API call (no user input needed)
- Fonts: Rely on Gamma's default (likely Inter or similar sans-serif)

**Quality Check:**
- Generate 3 test decks during UAT
- Verify logo appears on title slide
- Verify colors are consistently applied
- If Gamma's placement is unacceptable → **Fallback:** Add logo as image element on slide 1 manually in API call

**Post-MVP (Phase 2):**
- Build Google Slides API integration for pixel-perfect brand control
- Allow upload of custom brand kit (colors, fonts, logo variations, slide templates)

***

## Decision 5: Authentication & Access Control

**DECISION: Email/password login with LakeB2B domain whitelist**

**Rationale:**
- **Security:** Can't be fully open (cost abuse risk—someone runs 1,000 generations)
- **Simplicity:** Email/password is faster to implement than SSO (no Okta/Azure AD integration)
- **Flexibility:** Can grant access to partners, resellers, or Champions Group entities beyond @lakeb2b.com
- **Cost Tracking:** Each user account = trackable usage for billing/analytics

**Implementation:**

**Auth Stack:**
- **Library:** Clerk.dev (fastest Next.js auth integration, 5-10 users free tier)
- **Alternative:** Auth.js (formerly NextAuth) if you want self-hosted

**Access Control:**
```typescript
// Whitelist check after signup
const ALLOWED_DOMAINS = [
  'lakeb2b.com',
  'championsgroup.com',
  'ampliz.com',
  'championclub.in'
];

async function validateUser(email: string) {
  const domain = email.split('@')[1];
  if (!ALLOWED_DOMAINS.includes(domain)) {
    throw new Error('Access restricted to LakeB2B and Champions Group employees');
  }
  return true;
}
```

**User Flow:**
1. User visits pitch-deck-creator.lakeb2b.com
2. Lands on login page
3. Options:
   - **Sign up** (email + password) → Email verification sent
   - **Log in** (existing users)
4. After signup, system checks email domain:
   - If whitelisted → Account activated
   - If not whitelisted → "Access denied. Contact admin@lakeb2b.com for access."
5. Once logged in → Access to deck creator

**Admin Control:**
- You (CEO) can manually add non-whitelisted emails via Clerk dashboard (for partners)
- Usage dashboard shows per-user deck generation count

**Cost:**
- Clerk free tier: 5,000 monthly active users (plenty for MVP)
- If exceeded: $25/month for 10,000 MAU

**Post-MVP:**
- Add usage limits (e.g., 50 decks/user/month)
- Implement role-based access (Admin can edit service catalog, AEs can only generate)

***

## Decision 6: Research Depth Execution Model

**DECISION: Adaptive research depth based on data availability**

**Rationale:**
- **Cost Optimization:** Deep Research for every prospect is overkill—costs $0.50-0.75 per query set
- **Quality Preservation:** Simple/well-known companies (e.g., "Salesforce") need less research than obscure mid-market companies
- **User Experience:** Users shouldn't have to choose—system should be smart enough to adapt
- **Speed:** Quick research = 30-40s, Deep research = 60-90s. Faster when possible improves UX.

**Implementation Logic:**

```typescript
function determineResearchDepth(input: {
  companyName: string;
  companyUrl?: string;
  uploadedFiles: File[];
  industryKnown: boolean;
}): 'quick' | 'deep' {
  
  // Rule 1: User uploaded research files → Quick (files provide context)
  if (input.uploadedFiles.length > 0) {
    return 'quick'; // Perplexity supplements, doesn't need to go deep
  }
  
  // Rule 2: Well-known public company → Quick
  const publicCompanyList = ['Salesforce', 'Snowflake', 'HubSpot', 'Adobe', 
                             'Oracle', 'SAP', 'Microsoft', /* ... Fortune 1000 */];
  if (publicCompanyList.includes(input.companyName)) {
    return 'quick'; // Plenty of public info available, standard queries suffice
  }
  
  // Rule 3: Industry known + URL provided → Quick
  if (input.industryKnown && input.companyUrl) {
    return 'quick'; // Enough context to build solid pitch
  }
  
  // Rule 4: Obscure company / missing data → Deep
  return 'deep'; // Need comprehensive research to fill gaps
}
```

**Research Configuration:**

**Quick Research (30-40s, $0.25-0.35 cost):**
- Perplexity model: `sonar` (standard, not pro)
- Search depth: `standard`
- Queries: 3 (Company Overview, Tech Stack, Pain Points merged into one broad query)

**Deep Research (60-90s, $0.50-0.75 cost):**
- Perplexity model: `sonar-pro`
- Search depth: `deep`
- Queries: 5 (Company Overview, Tech Stack, Pain Points, Competitive Landscape, Buyer Personas—separate detailed queries)

**User Feedback:**
- Progress indicator shows: "Running comprehensive research..." (if deep) or "Researching {Company}..." (if quick)
- No explicit mention of "quick vs deep" to user—system just works

**Cost Impact:**
- **Scenario 1:** 100 decks/month, 60% quick (avg $0.30) + 40% deep (avg $0.65)
  - Cost: (60 × $0.30) + (40 × $0.65) = $18 + $26 = **$44/month on Perplexity**
- **Scenario 2:** All deep research: 100 × $0.65 = **$65/month**
- **Savings:** $21/month (32% reduction) without sacrificing quality

**Monitoring:**
- Log research depth decision for each job
- After 50 decks, analyze: Are "quick" decks rated lower than "deep" decks?
- If quality gap detected → Adjust rules to trigger "deep" more often

**Post-MVP:**
- Add "Force Deep Research" toggle for power users who want maximum detail
- ML model to predict research depth based on deck quality feedback
